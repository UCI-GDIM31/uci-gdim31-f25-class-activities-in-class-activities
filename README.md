1. The r, g, b variables a float because they contain decimal points in its values.
2. _bounce variable is an int because it utilizes whole numbers in its values.
3. Step 4 part 2 taught me that I must end the line with a semicolon (;).

1. Classes are like Batman. And is the user who holds all of his gadgets. Batman's variable are the gadgets (batarang or batmobile). Batman would use provide the function to the variables in order for them to be in action, just like a method to be put in action with his batarangs to explode. Batman becomes a component when he is attached to the batmobile, allowing it to move. 
2. The ball would get bright because there is no limit stopping its brightness, so it continously becomes brighter.

Table 16

Line 17
_isGrounded is a boolean and is set to true. It can be used as a method in the class

Line 28
It's an if statement, checking if _isGrunded is true or false. GetKeyDown is a method. If the KeyDown is pressed and _isGrounded is true then everything in the if statement is ran

Line 32
_isGrounded is set to false at the end of the if statement.

For the cat we put Rigidbody and Capsule Collider on it because it needs to collide with the ball and to interact with it as well. The cat is also an abnormal shape so Capsule Collider is the right component. SoccerBall we put n Rigidbody and Sphere Collider because the ball needs to collide with the cat and is the shape of a sphere. The Goal has Box Collider and "Is Trigger" is one because the ball needs to pass through for it to count as a goal. The first time, the cat was floating and made hitting the ball awkward. We fixed it by adjusting the collider to be above the floor and minor fixes to fit the cat's shape and position.
